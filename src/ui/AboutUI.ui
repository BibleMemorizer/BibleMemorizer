  &lt;p&gt;Version 2, June 1991&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Preamble&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
  Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
  change free software--to make sure the software is free for all
  its users. This General Public License applies to most of the
  Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
  whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
  Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public
  License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
  not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
  that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
  (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
  source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
  software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you
  know you can do these things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
  forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
  the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
  software, or if you modify it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
  whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the
  rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive
  or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so
  they know their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
  software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
  certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
  this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
  and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
  is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others
  will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
  free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
  making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it
  clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or
  not licensed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
  MODIFICATION&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.&lt;/strong&gt; This License applies to any program or
  other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
  saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General
  Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program
  or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the
  Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
  say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
  verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
  language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is
  addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
  are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The
  act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from
  the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work
  based on the Program (independent of having been made by running
  the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
  does.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; You may copy and distribute verbatim
  copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any
  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
  on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
  warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
  and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
  of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
  exchange for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; You may modify your copy or copies of the
  Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
  Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under
  the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
  these conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;dl&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a)&lt;/strong&gt; You must cause the modified files to
    carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and
    the date of any change.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;/dl&gt;

  &lt;dl&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b)&lt;/strong&gt; You must cause any work that you
    distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is
    derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as
    a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
    this License.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;/dl&gt;

  &lt;dl&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c)&lt;/strong&gt; If the modified program normally reads
    commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when
    started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
    way, to print or display an announcement including an
    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
    warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that
    users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and
    telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
    Program is not required to print an announcement.)&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;/dl&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
  Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part
  of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution
  of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
  permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and
  thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
  derivative or collective works based on the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
  Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
  a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
  other work under the scope of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; You may copy and distribute the Program
  (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or
  executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
  provided that you also do one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;dl&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a)&lt;/strong&gt; Accompany it with the complete
    corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;/dl&gt;

  &lt;dl&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b)&lt;/strong&gt; Accompany it with a written offer,
    valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a
    charge no more than your cost of physically performing source
    distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
    software interchange; or,&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;/dl&gt;

  &lt;dl&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c)&lt;/strong&gt; Accompany it with the information you
    received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source
    code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
    distribution and only if you received the program in object
    code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
    Subsection b above.)&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;/dl&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
  work for making modifications to it. For an executable work,
  complete source code means all the source code for all modules it
  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus
  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
  executable. However, as a special exception, the source code
  distributed need not include anything that is normally
  distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
  on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
  accompanies the executable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If distribution of executable or object code is made by
  offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
  equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
  counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
  object code.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or
  distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this
  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or
  distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
  your rights under this License. However, parties who have
  received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
  have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
  full compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; You are not required to accept this
  License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else
  grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
  derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do
  not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
  the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
  acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
  conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or
  works based on it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; Each time you redistribute the Program (or
  any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically
  receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute
  or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You
  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
  for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; If, as a consequence of a court judgment
  or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
  limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether
  by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
  conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
  conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
  satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
  any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
  not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
  Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
  through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
  License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
  Program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If any portion of this section is held invalid or
  unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of
  the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is
  intended to apply in other circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
  infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
  protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
  system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
  software distributed through that system in reliance on
  consistent application of that system; it is up to the
  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
  that choice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; If the distribution and/or use of the
  Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or
  by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who
  places the Program under this License may add an explicit
  geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not
  thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
  limitation as if written in the body of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; The Free Software Foundation may publish
  revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from
  time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
  present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
  or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following
  the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
  version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
  does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
  any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; If you wish to incorporate parts of the
  Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions
  are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For
  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals
  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
  software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
  generally.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.&lt;/strong&gt; BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF
  CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
  PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN
  WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
  PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
  RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
  YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.&lt;/strong&gt; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
  LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
  OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
  PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT
  OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
  LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
  LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
  PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
  OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
  greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this
  is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and
  change under these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
  effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file
  should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where
  the full notice is found.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;
&lt;var&gt;one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.&lt;/var&gt;
Copyright (C) &lt;var&gt;yyyy&lt;/var&gt;  &lt;var&gt;name of author&lt;/var&gt;

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.
&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
  paper mail.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice
  like this when it starts in an interactive mode:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) &lt;var&gt;year&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;name of author&lt;/var&gt;
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' 
for details.
&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The hypothetical commands &lt;samp&gt;`show w'&lt;/samp&gt; and
  &lt;samp&gt;`show c'&lt;/samp&gt; should show the appropriate parts of the
  General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
  called something other than &lt;samp&gt;`show w'&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;`show
  c'&lt;/samp&gt;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu
  items--whatever suits your program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You should also get your employer (if you work as a
  programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright
  disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample;
  alter the names:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
